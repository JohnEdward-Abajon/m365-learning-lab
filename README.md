# 🌐 Microsoft 365 Learning Lab

Hi! I'm currently learning how to manage and secure Microsoft 365 environments.  
This is my personal lab where I practice using tools like:

## 🔧 Skills I'm Working On
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Microsoft Intune (Endpoint Manager)
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Conditional Access & Security Policies
- Device Enrollment (Windows 10/11)
- PowerShell for M365 Admin tasks

## 📅 Learning Goals
- Join a device to Azure AD
- Enroll a Windows laptop in Intune
- Create and test Conditional Access rules
- Deploy Defender settings to a test device
- Use Microsoft 365 Security Center for alerts

## ✅ Why I Created This Repo
I plan to apply for the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program/) and use this environment to:
- Study cloud security best practices
- Practice device management in Intune
- Simulate a real-world enterprise setup
